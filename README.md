# Project Description
This project is an example project based on an extendable design system, rather than a static design system package. It is built on the Theme protocol and Token enum, allowing for expansion into various designs and facilitating easy identification and handling of changes. Additionally, it includes a design system compatible with both UIKit and SwiftUI.

# How to Import
> This project is intended to be used as a template that you can modify according to your needs. However, it can also be used as is if desired.
1. Copy the [DesignSystem > Foundation] folder from this project and paste it into your desired project. Alternatively, you can copy only the component folders you need. Note that the Util, Rounded, and Typo folders contain essential properties that all components depend on, so they must be included.
2. Select and copy the desired framework folder from [DesignSystem > UIKitComponent, SwiftUIComponent] and paste it into your project. Similarly, you can choose to copy only the components you need.
3. After that, update the Token and Theme to match your project's design system. If necessary, you can also modify the protocol or components.
